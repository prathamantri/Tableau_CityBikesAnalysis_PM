# Unit20_Tableau_CityBikesAnalysis_PM


Phenomenon 1: 
After plotting the data for Average trip Duration aganist the Age of riders, we find that the dataset collected by CityBike is faulty. The BirthYear recorded dates back to 1800s and thus the visualiztion shows users with ages betwwen 99 - 140 years as bike riders. 

Phenomenon 2:
From the visualizations we find that the most traffic/usage of bikes is from the Grove St Path Bike Station. However, it is interesting to note that more number of rides end at this station than starting at this station. 

Phenomenon 3:
We can also see that the Biking in winter months reduces overall as compared to summer months. The peak hours is 8 AM and 6 PM which doesnt change based on the season (Summer/Winter).
